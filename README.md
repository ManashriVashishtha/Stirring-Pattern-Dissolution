# Stirring-Pattern-Dissolution
A small self-driven experiment exploring how stirring patterns affect the dissolution rate of salt in water. 
________________________________
## Experiment Overview
**Goal:**  
To test whether different stirring patterns affect the rate at which salt dissolves in water.
________________________________
**Key Variables:**  
- **Solute:** Table Salt (NaCl)
- **Solvent:** Water at room temperature (30.8 degrees Celsius)
- **Quantities Tested:** 6g and 11g (salt), 140 ml (water)
- **Patterns Studied:**
  - Clockwise throughout
  - Change direction once or twice
  - Constant Direction Change (Clock–Anti–Clock…)
  - Back and Forth Stirring
________________________________
## Data Collection
I performed:
- 3 trials for each pattern and quantity (24 total observations)
- Timing was done manually with a tabletop timer (human error possible!)
- Used household tools: kitchen scale, thermometer, timer, and MATLAB for analysis

## Files Included

File: Purpose  
salt_dissolution_data.csv : Raw data of collected readings from the experiment  
dissolution_data_analysis.m : MATLAB script for data analysis and plotting of graphs  
6gram_Time_per_pattern : Graph of patterns vs time for 6g trials  
11gram_Time_per_pattern : Graph of patterns vs time for 6g trials

## Key Observations (and learning)

- Changing direction while stirring **does** seem to help dissolve salt faster
- Human-led experiments have lots of error sources
- Larger sample size and multiple trials are needed for accurate results
